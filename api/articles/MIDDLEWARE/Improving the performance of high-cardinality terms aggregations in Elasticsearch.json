For example, a terms aggregation on a field containing country names would create a bucket for USA, a bucket for Canada, a bucket for Spain, and so on. Under normal circumstances, terms aggregations are very fast, however in some exceptional cases they may be slow. One reason for slow terms aggregations may be a mis-configured cluster. Another reason for poor performance may be high-cardinality values on the field which a terms aggregation is executed on.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, I’ll first give a brief overview of general instructions that should be followed to ensure the best performance of an Elasticsearch cluster. This is then followed by several sections that present background material that will help to understand the underlying mechanics of terms aggregations, including (1) a definition of high cardinality, (2) a description of the refresh interval, and (3) a description of global ordinals. Next, I’ll show how to view the impact of building global ordinals on terms aggregation performance. Finally, I’ll present several techniques to improve the performance of high-cardinality terms aggregations, including (1) time-based indices, (2) eager global ordinals, and (3) techniques to prevent Elasticsearch from building global ordinals.</p>\n<p>In one instance, the techniques documented in this blog post were able to reduce the execution time of a high-cardinality terms aggregation that was running at a very large retail bank, from 15 seconds to below 15 milliseconds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"General-suggestions\"><a href=\"#General-suggestions\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"General suggestions\"></a>General suggestions</h2><p>Tuning a cluster can have a large impact on overall cluster performance. The following Elasticsearch documentation provides details on configuring and tuning an Elasticsearch cluster, and should be followed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/system-config.html\">Important system configuration</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/tune-for-search-speed.html\">Tune for search speed</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/tune-for-indexing-speed.html\">Tune for indexing speed</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/tune-for-disk-usage.html\">Tune for disk usage</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional information on tuning slow queries can be found in <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/advanced-tuning-finding-and-fixing-slow-elasticsearch-queries\">this blog about advanced Elasticsearch tuning</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, having too many shards is a common cause of performance problems. <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-many-shards-should-i-have-in-my-elasticsearch-cluster\">This blog about sharding</a> gives good rules of thumb to follow.</p>\n<p>The remainder of this blog focuses specifically on understanding and tuning terms aggregations.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"Cardinality\"><a href=\"#Cardinality\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Cardinality\"></a>Cardinality</h2><p>The performance of terms aggregations can be greatly impacted by the cardinality of the field that is being aggregated. Cardinality refers to the uniqueness of values stored in a particular field. High cardinality means that a field contains a large percentage of unique values. Low cardinality means that a field contains a lot of repeated values. For example, a field storing country names will be relatively low cardinality since there are less than two hundred countries in the world. Alternatively, a field storing IBAN numbers or email addresses is high cardinality since there may be millions of unique values stored.</p>\n<p>When discussing high cardinality in this blog post, we are referring to fields with hundreds of thousands or millions of unique values.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Elasticsearch-refresh-interval\"><a href=\"#Elasticsearch-refresh-interval\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Elasticsearch refresh interval\"></a>Elasticsearch refresh interval</h2><p>In order to understand the remainder of this blog, we must have a general understanding of the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/index-modules.html#dynamic-index-settings\">refresh interval</a>.</p>\n<p>As documents are inserted into Elasticsearch, they are written into a buffer and then periodically flushed from that buffer into <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/index-modules-merge.html#index-modules-merge\">segments</a>. This flush operation is known as a <em>refresh</em>, and newly inserted documents are only searchable after a refresh. By default refreshes occur every second, however the refresh interval is configurable.</p>\n<p>The refresh interval is relevant to performance because in the background, Elasticsearch merges small segments into larger segments, and those larger segments are merged into even larger segments, and so on. Therefore, by enabling frequent refreshes, Elasticsearch needs to do more background work merging small segments than it would need to do with less frequent refreshes which would create larger segments.</p>\n<p>While frequent refreshes are necessary if near real-time search functionality is required for newly inserted data, such frequent refreshes may not be necessary in other use cases. If an application can wait longer for recent data to appear in its search results, then the refresh interval may be increased in order to improve the efficiency of data ingestion, which in turn should free up resources to help overall cluster performance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Global-Ordinals\"><a href=\"#Global-Ordinals\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Global Ordinals\"></a>Global Ordinals</h2><p>Terms aggregations rely on <em>global ordinals</em> to improve efficiency. <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/eager-global-ordinals.html\">Global ordinals</a> is a data-structure that maintains an incremental numbering for each unique term for a given field. Global ordinals are computed on each shard, and by default subsequent terms aggregations will rely purely on those global ordinals to efficiently perform the aggregation at the shard level.  Global ordinals are then converted  to the real term for the final reduce phase, which combines results from different shards. If a shard is modified, then new global ordinals will need to be calculated for that shard.</p>\n<p>The performance of terms aggregations on high-cardinality fields may be slow and unpredictable in-part because (1) the time taken to build global ordinals will increase as the cardinality of the field increases, and (2) by default, global ordinals are lazily built on the first aggregation that occurs since the previous refresh. Furthermore, a combination of frequent document insertions, frequent refreshes, and frequently executed terms aggregations would cause global ordinals to be frequently recomputed. </p>\n<p>Additional details on global ordinal performance can be found in <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19780\">this GitHub issue</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-to-view-the-impact-of-global-ordinals-on-terms-aggregations\"><a href=\"#How-to-view-the-impact-of-global-ordinals-on-terms-aggregations\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How to view the impact of global ordinals on terms aggregations\"></a>How to view the impact of global ordinals on terms aggregations</h2><p>Elasticsearch log files are very helpful for detecting performance issues. Set <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/index-modules-slowlog.html\">log levels</a> to appropriate values, keeping in mind that excessive logging may increase disk IO and could negatively impact performance. Monitor the log file called <code>elasticsearch_index_search_slowlog.log</code>. If slow terms aggregations appear in the slowlog file, then their poor performance may be due to the building of global ordinals, which can be checked as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue to insert data into Elasticsearch to ensure that global ordinals will be rebuilt when we execute a terms aggregation. Copy the slow terms aggregation from the slowlog file and manually execute and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-profile.html\">profile it</a>, to get a feeling for where execution time is spent.</li>\n<li>Continue to insert data into Elasticsearch. Copy the terms aggregation from the slowlog file and manually execute it. While the terms aggregation is executing, simultaneously execute the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/cluster-nodes-hot-threads.html\">hot_threads api</a>. If hot threads generally returns results that include references to <code>GlobalOrdinalsBuilder</code>, then the code may be spending significant time building global ordinals.</li>\n<li>Temporarily <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/logging.html#configuring-logging-levels\">enable logging</a> of global ordinals information by executing the following command:&#96;&#96;&#96;<br>PUT _cluster&#x2F;settings {  “transient”:  {  “logger.org.elasticsearch.index.fielddata”:  “TRACE”  }  }  <figure class=\"highlight livecodeserver\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">This will <span class=\"built_in\">write</span> information about <span class=\"built_in\">time</span> spent building <span class=\"built_in\">global</span> ordinals <span class=\"built_in\">to</span> <span class=\"keyword\">the</span> `elasticsearch.<span class=\"built_in\">log</span>` <span class=\"built_in\">file</span>, such <span class=\"keyword\">as</span> <span class=\"keyword\">the</span> following:```</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"built_in\">global</span>-ordinals \\[&lt;field_name&gt;\\]\\[<span class=\"number\">1014089</span>\\] took \\[<span class=\"number\">592.3</span>ms\\]  </span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\nBe sure to set the logging back to the default value after completing the above, as performance may be impacted while logging is set to <code>TRACE</code>.</li>\n<li>The size of the global ordinals data structure for a given field can be seen by viewing <code>memory_size_in_bytes</code> when executing the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-stats.html\">indices stats</a> command as follows:&#96;&#96;&#96;<br>GET <index_name>&#x2F;_stats&#x2F;fielddata?fielddata_fields&#x3D;<field_name>  <figure class=\"highlight pgsql\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br><span class=\"line\">14</span><br><span class=\"line\">15</span><br><span class=\"line\">16</span><br><span class=\"line\">17</span><br><span class=\"line\">18</span><br><span class=\"line\">19</span><br><span class=\"line\">20</span><br><span class=\"line\">21</span><br><span class=\"line\">22</span><br><span class=\"line\">23</span><br><span class=\"line\">24</span><br><span class=\"line\">25</span><br><span class=\"line\">26</span><br><span class=\"line\">27</span><br><span class=\"line\">28</span><br><span class=\"line\">29</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">    </span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">The above commands should give an idea <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> building <span class=\"keyword\">global</span> ordinals <span class=\"keyword\">is</span> consuming significant resources.
